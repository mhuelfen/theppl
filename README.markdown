theppl
==============

theppl is a (p)robabilistic (p)rogramming (l)anguage/platform. For further details please
have a look at the [manual](https://github.com/riedelcastro/riedelcastro-maven-repo/raw/master/snapshots/com/github/riedelcastro/theppl/theppl-manual/0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/theppl-manual-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.pdf).

Install
--------
theppl uses sbt for building and installation. If you don't have maven on your machine,
get it [here](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt). Then run:

    sbt publish-local

Now the theppl library is installed locally and can be used by adding dependency to your sbt/maven builds.
